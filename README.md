# General information

This project has been made for ICY0006 Probability Theory and Statistics course taught at TalTech University. The main language used for the project is Python.

Two reports containing the information on the tasks on probability and statistical analysis on dataset can be found under <strong>probability.md</strong> and <strong>statistics.md </strong> respectively.<br>

Some visuals, representing the different calculation on the dataset can be found under <strong>results</strong> folder. All the necessary codes can be found inside the <strong>main.py</strong>.
